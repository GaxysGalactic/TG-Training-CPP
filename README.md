# How to find stuff

All the exercises are organized in SECTIONS, and the goal is to have them finished in a WEEK. Obviously, WEEKs make up MONTHs, and thus file directory hierarchy is based on that.

Month W > Week X > Section Y (VS Solution) > Exercise Z (VS Project)

Each section is worked upon on its own branch before being merged into main after a pull request is approved. Pull requests contain code reviews and comments.
